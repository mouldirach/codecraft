/**
 * This strategy is used when shell integration is enabled, but rich command detection was not
 * declared by the shell script. This is the large spectrum between rich command detection and no
 * shell integration, here are some problems that are expected:
 *
 * - `133;C` command executed may not happen.
 * - `633;E` comamnd line reporting will likely not happen, so the command line contained in the
 *   execution start and end events will be of low confidence and chances are it will be wrong.
 * - Execution tracking may be incorrect, particularly when `executeCommand` calls are overlapped,
 *   such as Python activating the environment at the same time as Copilot executing a command. So
 *   the end event for the execution may actually correspond to a different command.
 *
 * This strategy focuses on trying to get the most accurate output given these limitations and
 * unknowns. Basically we cannot fully trust the extension APIs in this case, so polling of the data
 * stream is used to detect idling, and we listen to the terminal's data stream instead of the
 * execution's data stream.
 *
 * This is best effort with the goal being the output is accurate, though it may contain some
 * content above and below the command output, such as prompts or even possibly other command
 * output. We lean on the LLM to be able to differentiate the actual output from prompts and bad
 * output when it's not ideal.
